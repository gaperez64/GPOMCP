# GPOMCP
Guaranteed POMCP is a partial-observation Monte Carlo Planning algorithm
for the guaranteed payoff optimization problem

Dependencies: AI-Toolbox

To compile, the Makefile must be edited to change /Users/gaperez/AI-Toolbox 
to the directory where you have your AI-Toolbox clone. (I have a clone
which you can use: https://github.com/gaperez64/AI-Toolbox)
